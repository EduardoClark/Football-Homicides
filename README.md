Homicides & Fútbol in Mexico
============================

The following script tries to look for a relationship between homicides in mexican cities with first division football teams on the days where the local team plays.


### Running the scripts

If you run the "RunAll.r" script you will get the following output

- "out-data/Matches2007_2011.csv" which includes the first division games in México from 2007 to 2011 with location, teams, score, date and time of game

- "out-data/PanelComplete.csv" which includes everyday between 2007-2011 for every city with first division football in México and the number of homicides per day and game info in case there was a game that day there.

Aditionally you will get the LaTex ready table for summary statistics and model results at the latex-plots folder.
